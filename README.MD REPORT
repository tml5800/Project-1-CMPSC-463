# Project Report — Time-Series Clustering and Segment Analysis on PulseDB

---

## 1. Description of Project
This project implements a system for **unsupervised clustering and analysis of time-series segments** (such as ECG, PPG, ABP signals from PulseDB). The focus is on **algorithmic design** rather than machine learning heuristics. The system has three main components:

1. **Divide-and-Conquer Clustering**  
   Recursively splits time-series into clusters based on similarity (correlation, Euclidean distance, or DTW).  

2. **Closest Pair Search**  
   Within each cluster, finds the two most similar time-series segments to validate cluster cohesion.  

3. **Maximum Subarray (Kadane’s Algorithm)**  
   Detects the strongest subsequence of activity in each signal, explaining why certain signals cluster together (e.g., bursts or spikes).  

The system outputs **clusters, closest pairs, activity windows, and visualizations**.
